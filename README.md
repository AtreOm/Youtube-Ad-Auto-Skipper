I used to hate having to skip ads always!
Imagine this, you could be busy driving or working and have put on your favourite songs on youtube and have to skip ad everytime it plays.

Use this script, it will open youtube in incognito chrome. Then play your songs and if there is an ad which can be skipped, it will auto skip it!
